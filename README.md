#### Model rendering and annotation tools

This is a code pool of Yida Wang, master student of Dr. Weihong Deng. Those codes are used for model rendering from 3D models to 2D synthetic images together with some specific annotation and contour generation. It's basically written in c++, but there are also some basic scripts for API.

Compiling is based on cmake and make, it's designed for Linux, MacOS and Unix.
